# Eklavya-Smart-Stand
## SRA Eklavya Project 

This project aims to make a self-sufficient phone stand with it's own camera and microcontroller that should be able to process a lightweight object classification/ object detection model in TinyML that can track a person and rotate the stand in 2-axes to follow the person primararily in frame. We will be exploring techniques such as blob detection and centroid tracking to be able to achieve the best accuracy in the microcontroller's processing power.
